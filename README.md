qGeod
=====

#Current Code
qGeod contains some of the tools used to compute geodesics in Lie groups for the purposes of quantum computing. 
The repository cotains:

1. A single threaded Nelder-Mead optimizer.
2. A MPI based global geodesic solver. 
3. A Mathematica notebook with details on quantum circuits.
4. Code to generate generalized Pauli matrices 

#Future Plans

1. Improve usability
2. Documentation
