##README


### What is this repository for?

* Designed to compute geodesics in Lie groups for quantum computation

* Includes a templated Nelder Mead Optimiser



### How do I get set up?

* Requires the Armadillo matrix library, which are header files only. For downloads and installation instructions see http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html

* When run with MPI, uses a leap-frog technique to calculate geodesics to far away unitaries.

* Build with 'make'

### Running the code?

* Input is a qGeod.mat. This file is where you set the target unitary operation.

* 'type ./qGeod to see options '


### Contribution guidelines
