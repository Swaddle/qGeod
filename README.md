##README


### What is this repository for?

* Designed to compute geodesics in Lie groups for quantum computation

* Includes a templated Nelder Mead Optimiser



### How do I get set up?

* Requires the Armadillo matrix library, which are header files only. For downloads and installation instructions see http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html

* Leapfrog solver routine in src/solvers

* /src/core contains templated Nelder Mead solver, code to generate Pauli matrices, and an implementation of the Nelder Mead for the unitary group

* Build with 'make'. Produces one

### Running the code?

* Require a qGeod.mat, this file is where you set the desired unitary operations

* './qGeod'

### Contribution guidelines


### Who do I talk to?

* meswaddle@gmail.com
